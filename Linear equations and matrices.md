# Linear Equations and Matrices
=============================

## Introduction
Matrices help solve systems of linear equations.

## Solving Linear Equations
* **Gaussian Elimination**: Row operations.
* **LU Decomposition**: Factorization.

## Example
Solve the system:

2x + 3y = 5
x - 2y = -3

Using matrix inversion:


[[2, 3], [1, -2]]^-1 Ã— [5, -3] = [x, y]
