# Vectors
================

## Definition
A vector is a mathematical object with magnitude and direction.

## Types of Vectors
* **Zero Vector**: A vector with zero magnitude.
* **Unit Vector**: A vector with magnitude 1.

## Vector Operations
* **Addition**: Vector sum.
* **Scalar Multiplication**: Scaling a vector.

## Example
Consider two vectors:

α = [2, 3]
β = [4, 5]

α + β = [6, 8]
